# Timed Web Development Code Quiz

## Description
This is a timed quiz web app about web development code. This application was created to learn more about setIntervals, timeIntervals. As well as getting more acquainted with Javascript selectors and functions. If you wanted to quiz yourself and see how well you do on this code quiz, as well as compare your quiz score with other players, you can take this short quiz. I've learned and am still learning on just how javascript seems to go about reading things. Calling if else statements, and for loops and such.

When the start button is clicked, a timer triggers and I'm presented with a question,and a timer starts. when I answer a question, I progress to the next question. If an answer is wrong, time is docked. When all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0 then the quiz game is over. Then I can save my initials and score, so that way, I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.
