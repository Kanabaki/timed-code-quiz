Code quiz
needs start button
when start button is clicked, a timer triggers and I'm presented with a question
when I answer a question, I progress to the next 
If an answer is wrong, time is docked
when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0, game is over
then I can save my initials and score

I WANT to store high scores SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
